install fabric using the fabric installer

place the .jar files into your mod folder

(the directory of the mod folder should look something like "This PC\OS(C:)\Users\(Name)\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft\mods

once fabric is done installing it should make a new profile that looks something like Release Fabric-loader 0.11.1 1.16.5

start the game in that profile and the mods should work perfectly fine
